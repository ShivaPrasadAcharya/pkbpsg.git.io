<h3> Don't just collect Zeros.Zero plus Zero is Zero. Zero multiplying Zero is Zero. Add some value before these collected zeros. Enjoy every moment to the fullest.</h3>
<h4> You are not born just to have a academic degrees. There is much higher purpose of life. Make an Inquiry into it & Demystify it.</h4>
<p> Life is preparation & Death is Examination. Better be Fail in your academic papers but never get fail in that Final Exam.</p>
<p> To Get+To Give = Pain<br>
ForGet + ForGive = Pleasure <br>
So do not seek love and attention from other & do not expose your love and attention to others.</p>
<p> एकबार झुक कर सम्बन्ध सुधार जाये तो झुक जाओ परन्तु बार बार आपको नै झुक्न परे तो रूक जाओ। </p>
